Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a solid foundation in statistics and data analytics. In
my probability coursework, I delved into elementary probability theory, conditional probability and
independence, discrete and continuous random variables, expected value, variance, covariance, and
correlation, as well as moment generating functions, the Law of Large Numbers, and the Central Limit
Theorem. In statistics, I explored numerical and visual exploratory data analysis, probability models,
point and interval estimation, estimator bias and mean squared error, single-sample, paired, and
two-sample inference and hypothesis testing, experimental design, analysis of variance, goodness of fit,
categorical data analysis, and simple linear regression models. Using RStudio's statistical software, I
became proficient in performing hypothesis testing and more.
My data analytics course offered a broad overview of modern methods and tools for big data analytics,
 covering the entire data analytics lifecycleâ€”from diagnosing and cleaning to preparing, transforming,
visualizing, and modeling data. This course emphasized the use of RStudio's tidyverse, along with tools
 like Excel, Google Spreadsheets, and Python. As an instructional assistant for this course, I've kept up
 with the latest updates in R, further enhancing my skills.
My journey with Python's matplotlib and pandas began in high school, where I learned to clean and
analyze datasets. I took these skills further in a data visualization course, creating complex plots such
as maps and correlograms. Over the years, I've worked with a variety of datasets, including mental health
clinic data, adoption agency data, census data, EQAO score data, and more. These experiences have
sharpened my ability to extract meaningful insights from data and present them effectively.
