      <h2>EQAO vs Suspension Rate Data Analysis</h2>
      <p>Analyzed EQAO scores and suspension rates in Ontario for the 2019-2020 school year to look for a correlation.</p>
      <p><strong>Year Started:</strong> 2024</p>
      <p><strong>Language:</strong> Python</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Used Pandas for Data preparation and Matplotlib to create four total plots</li>
        <li>Created complex visualizations including a labeled map using geopandas and a correlation matrix using seagram</li>
        <li>Found that schools with a higher percentage of students attaining the standard (especially in reading) had lower suspension rates, but that there are other significant factors as well</li>
        <li>Highlighted that current academic improvement efforts do not significantly impact suspension rates, calling for more effective strategies such as tailored education</li>
